<h1 class='pageTitle'>question a day</h1>
<p class='centeredtext'> In today's facebook flooded internet world, we're often inundated with other people's feelings. But so often it feels forced, as if they're asking for sympathy or looking for someone to acknowledge them. <em>Question a Day</em> is a simple attempt to allow for sharing of deep feelings without the need for sympathy or attention, just the idea that by putting your feelings out there, we just might all feel a bit more connected.  </p>
